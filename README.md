The Hiyori Desktop is a custom-made desktop with the cute Hiyori standing by your side and helping you with some easy work.  
### Functions: 
1. Application based (which means you need to add some application icons to the desktop in order to use them)  
2. Cute Hiyori Live2d model on the left, voice and a few click interactions available 
3. Use the input box underneath to chat with Hiyori, text feedback and voice feedback available 
4. Set time for study versus play (in study mode certain applications and websites will be disabled) 
5. Hosting of wechat (automatic reply for private chats)  

### Language: 
C++, python 
仅支持中文   

### Q&A:  
1.  Why the voice feedback goes wrong?      
    The voice and automatic reply functions are based on Internet which requires Turing Robots and Iflytek. I have not renewed for two years, thus it's likely to fail.  
2.  May I modify some parts?      
    Every change is welcomed and you do not need to contact me.
